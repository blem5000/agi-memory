# How an agent's identity was established, and therefore how much it is worth.
#
# MCP and A2A both carry no actor field, and no client convention exists to hang
# one on across the 13 assistants we support. So identity here is *derived*, and
# the kind travels with it so nothing downstream can mistake a process for a
# person:
#
#   "declared" -- AGI_AGENT_ID was set by whoever launched the harness. Trusted
#                 as a label, not as proof: an agent can set its own env.
#   "process"  -- host:pid:harness, i.e. which OS process wrote this. Two
#                 sub-agents of one parent share all of it, so it separates
#                 concurrent *processes* and nothing finer. That is still the
#                 right granularity for stopping two agents from collapsing into
#                 one session, which is what it is used for.

# The distinction matters because the alternative -- stamping an id on a claim
# and calling it provenance -- makes the field a fabrication of exactly the
# thing it exists to make true.

    This is the guard for the incident that produced a commit on the app repo's

    call passed `cwd=v_dir` -- it was `v_dir` itself resolving to a git

    origin, adds an unrelated one, renames the branch and pushes, and a later

    Checked in both directions, and after resolving symlinks, because the vault
    must neither be inside another repository nor contain one:

      - vault inside a repo  -> `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is an ancestor
      - repo inside a vault  -> the vault has no `.git` of its own but a
